Reinventing the wheel on Project/Task Management in Kotlin

## Basic Idea
Basically testing out Kotlin and in the process possibly making a standalone Task Management / Project Management Tool.
This will include many of the basics that everyone knows and loves, and hopefully includes the extras that aren't normally available to everyone.
If I really get started on this I will then include the roadmap of features, but for the moment I am investigating what I can do and what is already out there.

## Current Issues
Gradle doesn't work properly, even though the code tests properly :)
